-- SQL Schema
-- Table: Employees

-- +-------------+----------+
-- | Column Name | Type     |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- | employee_id | int      |
-- | name        | varchar  |
-- | manager_id  | int      |
-- | salary      | int      |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- employee_id is the primary key for this table.
-- This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
 

-- Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

-- Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

-- The query result format is in the following example.
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT employee_id from Employees
WHERE manager_id not in 
(SELECT distinct employee_id FROM Employees)
and salary < 30000
ORDER BY employee_id
